MovieLens Recommendation System

HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate: PH125.9x Capstone project(1)

The objective of this project is to develop a recommendation system using the MovieLens 10M dataset that predicted ratings with a residual mean square error of less than 0.86490.

This report discusses a few methods used to construct recommendation systems. The best performing model is regularized movie and user effects, which yields an RMSE of 0.8648000 when trained on edx and tested on validation.

Finally, our final model can be improved more if we explore more techniques like matrix factorization, which may give better results.
